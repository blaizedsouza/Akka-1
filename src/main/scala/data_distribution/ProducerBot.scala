/**
  * Created by pabloperezgarcia on 19/02/2017.
  *
  * With Akka cluster distributed data we can use the Replicator Actor, which we can subscribe to a ORSetKey-actor.
  * This ORSetKey itÂ´s a combination of object and key, the object it will be the data to modify/increase/reduce in the cluster
  * For instance it could be a Set of events to be distributed through of cluster.
  *
  * In this example the producer it will subscribe to a specific ORSetKey and it will modify this one using scheduler.
  *
  * All nodes subscribed with the same ORSetKey will recveive the notification of change in "element @ Changed(DataKey)"
  *
  * Official doc
  * http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.16/scala/distributed-data.html

    * In Akka cluster distributed data we can write the changes in different ways:
    *
    * WriteLocal the value will immediately only be written to the local replica, and later disseminated with gossip
    * WriteTo(n) the value will immediately be written to at least n replicas, including the local replica
    * WriteMajority the value will immediately be written to a majority of replicas, i.e. at least N/2 + 1 replicas, where N is the number of nodes in the cluster (or cluster role group)
    * WriteAll the value will immediately be written to all nodes in the cluster (or all nodes in the cluster role group)
